# Weather Data Processor

## Overview

`WeatherDataProcessor` is a Python class designed for asynchronous and parallel processing of weather data. It facilitates the reception, transformation, and storage of weather data files, specifically GRIB files.

## Components

- `WeatherDataProcessor`: The main class orchestrating the data processing.
- `receiver`: An asynchronous function to receive file paths.
- `load_pipeline` and `transform_pipeline`: Lists of functions representing the steps in the data processing pipelines.
- `Task`: A class representing individual processing tasks.
- `simple_worker`: A function that executes tasks from a queue.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Instance of `WeatherDataProcessor` is created with a data source URL.
   - Worker processes are spawned for parallel task execution.

2. **Data Reception**:
   - File paths are received asynchronously from the specified source.

3. **Loading Pipeline**:
   - For each file path, a task is created and queued.
   - Tasks in the `load_pipeline` perform initial processing steps like uncompressing and extracting data.

4. **Transform Pipeline**:
   - Processed files are paired and additional tasks are created for further processing.
   - Tasks in the `transform_pipeline` perform operations like data subtraction, sentinel value replacement, and binary file building.

5. **Task Processing**:
   - Each task is processed by worker processes in parallel.
   - Tasks involve reading data, applying transformations, and saving results.

6. **Completion**:
   - The program waits for all tasks to complete before finishing execution.

## Key Functions

- `_spawn_processes(num_proc)`: Spawns worker processes for parallel execution.
- `_set_task(context, pipeline)`: Creates and queues a task with the given context and pipeline.
- `_run()`: Orchestrates the entire data processing workflow.
- `run()`: Entry point to start the processing.

## Usage

To use `WeatherDataProcessor`, instantiate it with a source URL and call the `run` method:

```python
processor = WeatherDataProcessor(source='http://example.com/data')
processor.run()
```

This will start the process of downloading, processing, and transforming the weather data files as per the defined pipelines.
